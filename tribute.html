        <p>One of the most important revolutionaries in the Indian Nationalist Movement is <b>Bhagat Singh</b>. <b>On September 28, 1907,</b> Kishan Singh and Vidyavati gave birth to Bhagat Singh in Banga, Lyallpur District (now Pakistan). When he was born, his uncles Ajit and Swaran Singh, as well as his father Kishan Singh, were all imprisoned for protesting the 1906 Colonization Bill. Being raised in a politically conscious household where his family supported the Ghadar party, young Bhagat Singh developed a sense of patriotism. Bhagat Singh started supporting Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement at a very young age. Bhagat Singh openly resisted the British and carried out Gandhi's request by setting fire to publications that were sponsored by the government. In fact, he quit school altogether to enrol in Lahore's National College. The 1919 <b>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</b> and the 1921 murder of unarmed Akali demonstrators at the Nankana Sahib both occurred when he was a teenager, and both events strongly influenced his patriotic viewpoint.Bhagat Singh's family adhered to the Gandhian philosophy of using non-violence to achieve Swaraj, and for a while, he also backed the Indian National Congress and the objectives of the Non-Cooperation Movement. After the Chauri Chaura Incident, Gandhi demanded that the movement against non-cooperation be abandoned. Bhagat Singh disassociated himself from Gandhi's nonviolent effort because of the choice and joined the Young Revolutionary Movement instead. Thus began his career as the most well-known proponent of a bloody uprising against the British Raj.</p>
